        <b>Natural language processing (NLP)</b> is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence concerned with the     interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language data.
\n\n\n
    Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\n\n
        <b>With IBM Watsonâ„¢ Natural Language Understanding</b>, developers can analyze semantic features of text input, including categories, concepts, emotion, entities, keywords, metadata, relations, semantic roles, and sentiment.\n\n\n
        <b>Features :</b>\n
Send requests to the API with text, HTML, or a public URL, and specify one or more of the following features to analyze:\n\n\n
        <b>Categories</b>\n
Categorize your content using a five-level classification hierarchy. View the complete list of categories here. For example:
\n\n
Input

url: "www.cnn.com"

Response

/news
/art and entertainment
/movies and tv/television
/news
/international news
\n\n
        <b>Concepts</b>\n
Identify high-level concepts that aren't necessarily directly referenced in the text. For example:
\n\n
Input
\n
text: "Natural Language Understanding uses natural language processing to analyze text."
\n
Response

<b>Emotion</b>\n
Analyze emotion conveyed by specific target phrases or by the document as a whole. You can also enable emotion analysis for entities and keywords that are automatically detected by the service. For example:
\n
Input
\n
text: "I love apples, but I hate oranges."
targets: "apples", and "oranges"

Response

"apples": joy
"oranges": anger

<b>Entities</b>\n
Find people, places, events, and other types of entities mentioned in your content. View the complete list of entity types and subtypes here. For example:
\n
Input
\n
text: "IBM is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries."
\n
Response
\n
IBM: Company
Armonk: Location
New York: Location
United States: Location
